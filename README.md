`comai` is an open source terminal assistant powered by OpenAI API that enables you to interact with your command line interface using natural language instructions. It simplifies your workflow by converting natural language queries into executable commands. No more memorizing complex syntax. Just chat with `comai` using plain English!

## Installation üöÄ

Getting `comai` up and running is a breeze. You can simply use [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the latest tested version:

```shell
pip install comai
```

However, if you usualy work with different python environments, since this python package only contains a script it makes sense to use [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) instead:

```shell
pipx install comai
```

The first time you run it, it'll ask you for an OpenAI API key. You can create a developer account [here](https://platform.openai.com/overview). Once in your account, go to `API Keys` section and `Create new secret key`. We recommend setting a usage limit under `Billing`/`Usage limits`.

## Usage Examples üéâ

Using `comai` is straightforward. Simply invoke the `comai` command followed by your natural language instruction. `comai` will provide you with the corresponding executable command, which you can execute by pressing Enter or ignore by pressing any other key.

Let's dive into some exciting examples of how you can harness the power of `comai`:

1. Unleash your creativity with an ASCII art cow:
```shell
$ comai print a cow saying Moo!
‚ùØ cowsay Moo!
```

2. Master the intricacies of `git`:
```shell
$ comai squash the last 3 commits into a single commit
‚ùØ git rebase -i HEAD~3
```


3. Check the weather forecast for your location:
```shell
$ comai show me the weather forecast
‚ùØ curl wttr.in
```

3. Find the annoying process using the port 8000:
```shell
$ comai show me the process using port 8000
‚ùØ lsof -i :8000
```

4. Swiftly get rid of all your docker containers:
```shell
$ comai stop and remove all running Docker containers
‚ùØ docker stop $(docker ps -aq) && docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

These are just a few examples of how `comai` can help you harness the power of the command line and provide you with useful and entertaining commands. Feel free to explore and experiment with the commands generated by `comai` to discover more exciting possibilities!
